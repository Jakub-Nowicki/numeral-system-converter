# numeral-system-converter

## Overview
**Number Converter** is a Python-based web application built using **Flask**. This app provides a user-friendly web interface to convert numbers between decimal and any base from 2 to 16. It supports conversions to and from bases including binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal.

## Features
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Uses Flask to manage web requests and serve pages, allowing users to input numbers and select bases for conversion.
- **Support for Multiple Bases**: Converts numbers between decimal and bases ranging from binary (base 2) to hexadecimal (base 16).
- **Dynamic Form Update**: The web page dynamically updates to show conversion results without reloading.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) web application framework.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating and styling the user interface.
